Installation of mutils requires MATLAB and a working C compiler that
works with the MEX environment. To install mutils, uncompress the ZIP
package, in the MATLAB command window change the directory to the top
mutils directory and type 'install'.

The tools have been verified to compile with gcc and Visual Studio
compilers. Support for other compilers will come if requested. The
compiler options can be changed in mutils/utils_config.m

Compilers
 - On Unix-like system gcc can be used
 - On Windows, please install the Windows SDK
